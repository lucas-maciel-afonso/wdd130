            <p>Hello everyone!
                My name is Lucas Maciel Afonso, and I’m a 21-year-old currently pursuing software development. 
                I’ve had the opportunity to gain experience in this field while studying computer science at a 
                university here in Acre (yes, that’s the name of the place where I live!). Ever since I was a kid, 
                I’ve been passionate about technology, and I’m thrilled to collaborate and work with all of you.</p>

Bounded north by Amazonas state, it has western and southern frontiers with Peru and southeastern with Bolivia. The capital is Rio Branco on the Rio Acre in the eastern part of the state.</p>
